                    <p>
                        Buttock Augmentation is a cosmetic surgery performed on patients who wish to have a fuller, rounder butt. Many factors can lead to a flat or deflated buttock such as weight loss, age, and natural gravity. For many, this procedure
                        is sought as an instant enhancement. Fat transfer using fat from the patient’s own body or semi-solid silicone implants are popular methods for butt augmentation.

                    <h4>Why It’s Done</h4>
                    <p>
                        As you get older, your skin changes and becomes looser. In addition, sun damage, fluctuations in weight and genetic factors can contribute to poor skin elasticity. These factors can cause your buttocks, as well as other parts of
                        your body, to sag.
                    </p>
                    <p> A buttock lift is typically done in combination with other body contouring procedures. You might consider a buttock lift if you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have lost a significant amount of weight and your weight has been stable for at least six to 12 months</li>
                        <li>Are overweight and haven’t been able to lose a significant amount of weight through physical activity and changes in your diet</li>
                        <li>Have a normal weight, but want a dramatic improvement in the appearance of your lower body</li>
                        <li>Have a normal weight, but your skin won’t contract after liposuction due to poor elasticity related to aging</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Have a normal weight, but your skin won’t contract after liposuction due to poor elasticity related to aging. <br><br> Keep in mind that a buttock lift won’t change your skin quality. <br><br> A buttock lift isn’t for everyone.
                        Your doctor might caution against a buttock lift if you:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have a severe chronic condition, such as heart disease or diabetes</li>
                        <li>Plan to lose a significant amount of weight</li>
                        <li>Have a body mass index that’s greater than 32</li>
                        <li>Are a smoker</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>After The Procedure</h4>
                <p>
                    After a buttock lift, your incision will likely be covered with surgical dressing. One or more drains are typically placed under the wound and close to the incision line to drain any excess blood or fluid.<br><br> Follow the instructions
                    such as:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Walk as early as the first day after a buttock lift to help prevent the formation of blood clots.</li>
                    <li>Take your medication if you likely feel moderate pain.</li>
                    <li>Drains might be left in place for several weeks after surgery. You’ll be shown how to empty and care for your drains.</li>
                    <li>You might need to continue taking an antibiotic and a medication to prevent blood clots (anticoagulant) after your buttock lift.</li>
                    <li>After a few days, begin wearing a supportive garment for the next few weeks. This will help prevent fluid buildup and provide support while you heal.</li>
                    <li>For the first months after a buttock lift, you’ll need to take care when moving — increasing your activity level slowly — and avoid positions that strain your incision line to prevent the reopening of the wound.</li>
                    <li>In addition, follow-up visits with your doctor will be needed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Scar management might include use of silicone sheeting, scar cream and massage. The appearance of your scar will improve over time.</p>

                <h4>Results</h4>
                <p>
                    By removing excess skin and fat from your buttocks, a buttock lift can give you a more toned appearance.<br><br> Buttock lift results are usually long lasting. Keep in mind that maintaining a stable weight is crucial for retaining
                    your results.

                <h5>Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
                <span>How long do buttock implants last?</span>
                <p>
                    Under normal circumstances, the results of your buttock augmentation surgery will be long-lasting. Silicone butt implants are safe and can look fabulous for 10 years or more. Analogous fatty tissue graft will merge with your own tissues,
                    providing permanent results.
                </p>

                <span>What are butt injections?</span>

                <p>
                    Butt injections are a cosmetic procedure where fat is injected into the butt in order to make it larger. The Brazilian Butt Lift is the only FDA approved method. With this procedure, the fat is grafted from other parts of the patient’s
                    body via liposuction and transferred into the butt and hips to create a curvy figure.
                </p>

                <span>What is the difference between butt implants and a Brazilian Butt Lift?</span>

                <p>
                    Butt implants are made of a solid, gel-like silicone. The implants are inserted through an incision made between the crack of the butt. Therefore, butt implants pose a higher risk and complication rate than a Brazilian Butt Lift. Implants
                    will only add volume to the butt. They cannot reshape the butt like the Brazilian Butt lift can for a patient. If a person loses weight, the implant can become noticeable. With a Brazilian Butt Lift, the fat isn’t encased in an
                    implant shell so the doctor can easily reshape the butt and hips. If any weight is lost after the injections, the fat will simply be lost but not malformed. The injected fat has a soft, natural feel while implants can feel like
                    a tightened muscle.
