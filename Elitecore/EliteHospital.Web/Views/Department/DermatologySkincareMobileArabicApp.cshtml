                                        The difference between conventional laser recovery and fractional laser is the period of recovery and severe swelling and redness. The side effects of fractional laser will last between 3 days to a week maximum.

                                        Q-Switch is able to remove tattoos and pigmentation with a laser, by penetrating the layers of the skin which then heats the tattoo particles and separates them into smaller parts, which the body then removes. This
                                        technique is painless and safe. The patient can resume day to day activities after the session. The tattoo is removed in its various colors such as blue, black, red and green.

                                        Botox is a substance derived from a particular type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. This substance is called botulinum toxin, recently it has been used in many medical operations. When injected into the
                                        skin, Botox prevents the delivery of nerve impulses to the muscles, reducing muscular tension and muscle contraction. This greatly relaxes muscles and reduces the appearance of wrinkles, making the face appear
                                        flat and more comfortable.
